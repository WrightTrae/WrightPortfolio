                    N没 helps people better organize their food by keeping track of what they have and suggesting
                    recipes based on the food they currently have. On top of that N没 will also notify the user before
                    food items perish date. This app gives you the knowledge to cook a meal every night without having
                    to hopelessly search through recipes that you found online for the perfect recipe that you have all
                    the ingredients for. All you have to do is receipt as soon as you get home and then you will
                    instantly receive recommendations for what to eat.
