        <body>I was looking through reddit and I found this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/c468u1/what_is_this_type_of_illustration_called_whats/ and I really enjoyed the style of the illustration. This made me want to give this illustration style a try, so I replicated the Flat Design person from the reddit post then made a couple other versions.</body>

        <p>Self Project | 2017</p>
        <body>The application is designed for parents so they can make sure when and if their children get home safely. The main use is letting the parent(s) know exactly what time their child made it home and if it was before or after a curfew they set. Parents can set a curfew for a child using the app and then the child has to be home before the curfew or the parent will be notified. The way that the child verifies that they are home is by an NFC box placed somewhere in the household and the child has to scan the box to confirm they are home.</body>

        <h3>Vex Marble sorter</h3>
        <p>Group Project | 2015</p>
        <body>This was created using VEX programing software and VEX robotics equipment without a guide/ kit. It the flashlight to shine light into the marble so the light sensor mounted under frame can detect what color it is based on the amount of light that passed throughout the marble. If the program can not get a solid reading of the marble it will re-scan the marble 3 times and average the results to find the correct color. Then a gear spins one of four dixie cups into the correct position to catch the marble.</body>
